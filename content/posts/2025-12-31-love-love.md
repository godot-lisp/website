# 0-0: A Fresh Start

Just like a 0-0 score in soccer, where the game begins with perfect balance and endless possibilities, we're excited to announce the initial release of **Goli** - our Lisp extension for the Godot game engine.

## What is Goli?

Goli brings the power of Lisp's functional programming, interactive development, and expressive syntax to Godot. Whether you're a seasoned Lisp developer or new to functional programming, Goli opens up new ways to create games.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Development**: Hot-reload your Lisp code while the game runs
- **Functional Programming**: Leverage Lisp's immutable data structures and higher-order functions
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside GDScript and other Godot languages
- **Performance**: Compiled Lisp code runs at native speeds

## Getting Started

Head over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godot-lisp/goli) to download the latest release and start building games with Lisp!

Stay tuned for more updates as we develop this exciting project. The game is just beginning! ⚽
