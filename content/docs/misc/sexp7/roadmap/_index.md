# Roadmap

This is largely inherited at this point in time, from godot-s7-scheme's readme eqv.

## Current Capabilities

- ✅ Use Godot API from Scheme
- ✅ Live coding interface via Emacs
- ✅ Basic Godot integration

## Planned Features

- **Enhanced API Exposure**: Expose tree-sitter API to Scheme
- **Improved Editor Support**: Scheme editor with syntax highlighting
- **Documentation Tools**: Scheme notebooks
- **Signal System**: Expose Godot signals from Scheme
- **Object System**: Subclass Godot classes from Scheme
- **Language Registration**: Register Scheme as a proper script language extension

## Development Priorities

1. **API Completion**: Finish exposing all Godot APIs to Scheme
2. **Tooling**: Improve development tools and editor integration
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive examples and tutorials
4. **Performance**: Optimize the integration for production use
5. **Stability**: Move from experimental to stable release

## Long-term Vision

Sexp7 serves as a research platform for understanding how to integrate Lisp-like languages with Godot's architecture. The lessons learned here will inform the development of Goli, the full-featured Godot Lisp implementation.
