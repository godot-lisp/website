### Something More Practical, Short-Term

{{< glitz-showcase-item title="Sexp7 - GDExtension Research" icon="fas fa-flask" >}}
A fork of godot-s7-scheme serving as our implementation guide for GDExtension integration. This research project helps us understand how to properly integrate Lisp interpreters with Godot's extension system.
